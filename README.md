# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
perform Data Segmentation using the Clustering method, compare several Supervised Learning models and can create a simple neural network (not a CNN, but with a perceptron model) for the MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset

# Task 1
Comparing three models with the resulting accuracy results

# Task 2
Clustering

# Taks 3
Deep Learning for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using PyTorch. This is an exploration task. Develop your end-to-end workflow for solving
a Handwritten Digit Classification task using Neural Network architecture (not Convolutional Neural Network).

# Bonus Taks
This problem description is the same as Task 3. But there are some technical challenges that you have to choose one.
1. Compare 3 different configurations while your model is
wider/deeper. Show and explain the performance result.
2. Compare 3 configurations for different Loss Function. Show and
explain your performance result.
3. Compare 3 configurations for the activation function. Show and
explain your performance result.
